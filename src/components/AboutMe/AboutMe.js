        <p id="paragraph">My name is David Kapaku. I am originally from The Republic of
        Korea. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years and have studied culinary
        arts since I was 6 years old. My friends call me DK but I also go by the name, "HandsomestKorean"
        online. The name was a joke that went too far and since then it stuck with me for about 9 years now. 
        My hobbies include learning new concepts, trivia, listening to music, and playing
        online games.I enjoy games such as League of Legends, VALORANT, and Escape from Tarkov. My goal
        in the tech industry is to eventually work in the gaming industry as a front-end developer.
